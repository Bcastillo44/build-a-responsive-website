# Nippy - Project 1
Project 1 - Build a Responsive [Website] (!

  Using HTML and CSS, pick one of a few provided designs from the mocks provided from Adobe XD and build an honest replica and convert it into a website!
  
  ***
  
 ## Getting Started
 
  The goal is to build an accurate clone of your chosen site. Do your best to get everything looking as similar as possible. Treat it like you were handed this mockup and given a deadline to deliver it. Use all the available resources you've been given - documentation, your peers, your instructors, placeholder images, etc

  Additionally, your site should be responsive (meaning it looks good on mobile, tablet, and desktop).

  Use media queries to rearrange content so that it looks good on different devices. If your mock only has designs for desktop, then it's up to you to figure out how to make it look good on mobile. Great! It's really common in the industry for designers to come up with the desktop designs and then have the developers figure out the best way to present it on mobile and tablet.
